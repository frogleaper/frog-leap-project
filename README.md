# Bar Soap Production Forecast using Frog Leap Algorithm (FLA)

This project uses the **Frog Leap Algorithm (FLA)**, a metaheuristic optimization method, to forecast production for the next 5 months in a Bar Soap company.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

You are given past monthly production data from a Bar Soap manufacturing company. Your task is to **predict/forecast** the production quantity for the next 5 months using the **Frog Leap Algorithm**.

---

## üß† Methodology

### What is the Frog Leap Algorithm?
The **Frog Leap Algorithm (FLA)** mimics the behavior of frogs searching for food. It works by:
- Dividing frogs (solutions) into **memplexes**
- Evolving each memplex by **local search** (leaps)
- Sharing information globally by **shuffling frogs**

### Steps Followed
5. Export the forecasted results to an Excel file
1. Simulate historical monthly production data
2. Fit a **polynomial model** to production using optimized parameters
3. Use FLA to minimize the **mean squared error** of the model
4. Forecast the next 5 months using the best-fit model

## üìä Data

Simulated production data for 10 months:

```
[1020, 1100, 1080, 1150, 1200, 1180, 1250, 1300, 1290, 1350]
```

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

```bash
python app.py
```

This will:
- Run the FLA to find the best polynomial model
- Predict production for the next 5 months
- Show a plot of historical vs forecasted data
